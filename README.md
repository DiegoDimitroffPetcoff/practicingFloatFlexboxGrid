# practicing float model
Easy project to practice floating model with responsive layout, flexBox and Grid.
I made this project just to show my practice using the same HTML code with a different layout with float, flexbox and grid.
In stile.css you will find float css practice, this one is made with responsive design without @. You will find flexbox css and grid css file easily, all of them can be used in the same html code
